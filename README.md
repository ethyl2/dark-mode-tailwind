# Experiments with Dark Mode and Tailwindcss

I'm a big fan of tailwind. A preference for dark mode is growing on me. I'm interested in seeing how easy it might be to use tailwind to toggle a dark mode display.

I've also been using alternatives to normal lorem ipsum lately, so I thought it would be interesting to make my own version of a lorem ipsum generator using literature in the public domain. This page will generate lorem ipsum-like text using The Wizard of Oz.
## To run this project:

1. Clone it.
2. `npm i` in terminal
3. Start the tailwind build process: `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch `
