# Experiments with Dark Mode and Tailwindcss

I'm a big fan of tailwind. A preference for dark mode is growing on me. I'm interested in seeing how easy it might be to use tailwind to toggle a dark mode display.

To run this project:

1. Clone it.
2. `npm i` in terminal
3. Start the tailwind build process: `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch `
